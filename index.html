                    <br>

                    biggest city is Indonesia. It is the only
                    city in Indonesia that has the status of province. Jakarta is located on the northwest coast of
                    Java.

                    international world
                    Jakarta also has the nickname J-Town, or more popular The Big Durian because it is considered a city
                    comparable
                    to New York City (Big Apple) in Indonesia.</p>
